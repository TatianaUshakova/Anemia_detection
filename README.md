# Anemia Detection using Deep Learning

Warning: project now in the process of being upload to GitHub and doesnt contain all the necessary components to be fully function

Anemia detection using deep learning techniques, designed for deployment in rural areas of India where anemia-related complications, especially among pregnant women, are common and access to medical help is limited. The project includes automated tools for:

- Color correction from a color card
- Image segmentation
- Data cleaning and exploration
- Multiple predictive models ranging from classical regression on mean colors to convolutional neural networks (CNNs)

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview
The goal of this project is to provide a reliable tool for anemia detection in regions with limited medical resources. The original patient data used for model training involved Indian patients and remains private. For demonstration purposes, publicly available images similar to those used in the original project are included. The images analyzed include the conjunctiva, nails, palms, and tongue, as paleness in these areas can indicate anemia.

## ðŸ“¦ Project Structure
- `src/` - Source code including preprocessing, models, and utilities
- `data/` - Contains public images for demonstration only
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for exploratory analysis
- `tests/` - Unit tests for verifying code components
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies

## ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TatianaUshakova/Anemia_detection
   cd anemia-detection
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Run the color correction pipeline if needed:**
   The color correction pipeline adjusts the colors in images using the color card.
   ```bash
   python -m data_preprocessing.color_correction.full_pipeline <folder_path> [<image_list>]
   ```
   - `<folder_path>`: Path to the folder containing the images.
   - `[<image_list>]`: Optional. Provide a list of image names, a CSV/Excel file, or leave empty to process all images in the folder.

4. **Run the image segmentation pipeline (if available):**
   The image segmentation pipeline extracts regions of interest from the images.
   ```bash
   python -m data_preprocessing.image_segmentation.full_pipeline <folder_path> [<segmentation_parameters>]
   ```
   - `<folder_path>`: Path to the folder containing the images.
   - `[<segmentation_parameters>]`: Optional. Specify parameters for the segmentation algorithm (e.g., thresholds, masks).

5. **Run the prediction model pipeline (if available):**
   The RGB prediction model analyzes image RGB values and predicts specific outcomes.
   ```bash
   python -m data_preprocessing.rgb_prediction_model.predict <folder_path> [<model_parameters>]
   ```
   - `<folder_path>`: Path to the folder containing the images.
   - `[<model_parameters>]`: Optional. Specify parameters for the model, such as the path to a pre-trained model or specific prediction thresholds.

6. **Deactivate the virtual environment after use:**
   ```bash
   deactivate
   ```
